# node-sword-interface
node-sword-interface is a Javascript nodejs module (using [N-API](https://nodejs.github.io/node-addon-api/)) that wraps the [SWORD library](http://www.crosswire.org/sword/)
for use within nodejs applications. It has been created for use within the [Ezra Project](https://github.com/tobias-klein/ezra-project)
bible study software, but it can also be used for any other Javascript-based software that needs to interface
with the SWORD library.
